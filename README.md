# DataStructuresJava
This project contains basic Data Structures implemented in Java in order to provide a way to know how Standard Data Structures work internally.


## Implemented Data Structures


We have the following Data Structures with unit tests:

### LinkedList

	init method:     	   O(1)
	insert method:   	   O(n)
	retrieve method:       O(n)
	delete method:   	   O(n)
	// TODO insert in the end O(1) (with tail pointer)
    // TODO delete in the end O(1)


### Stack
	init method:     	   O(1)
	push method:   	   	   O(n)
	peek method:       	   O(n)
	delete method:   	   O(n)


## Running the tests

If you want to run the project you need to have maven installed and run:

		$> mvn clean test
